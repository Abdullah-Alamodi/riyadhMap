So they told me find another hotel for your last 2 days in Riyadh.They were lying and stating that Travel perk cancelled my reservation and at the end we found out that they did it.\n\nThen, on Nov 9 they called and informed me again that i need to leave same day and make check our because the hotel is fully booked noting that my second reservation was until Nov 10 and not Nov 9.\nThought I was dealing with a luxurious hotel but they were very unprofessional. Not recommended at all."

While the accommodations were comfortable, one major issue left a sour taste in my mouth and ruined an otherwise pleasant stay.\n\nThe breakfast buffet staff strictly forbade guests from taking food back to their rooms, which I found utterly ridiculous and inconvenient. It showed a complete lack of consideration for guests who might be unwell or have unique circumstances. Providing room service or at the very least, allowing guests the option to enjoy their breakfast in their rooms, should be a basic offering.\n\nFurthermore, the monotonous breakfast menu remained unchanged throughout my entire stay. The lack of variety was tedious and uninspiring. A hotel of this caliber should strive to offer a diverse and exciting dining experience, with daily specials or seasonal variations to entice guests.\n\nI left the hotel feeling frustrated and disappointed. I sincerely hope that management takes feedback seriously and makes the necessary improvements. A few simple changes could make all the difference in ensuring guest satisfaction."

Each dish was thoughtfully prepared, showcasing quality ingredients and attention to detail. I was particularly impressed with the live cooking stations, where chefs expertly prepared dishes to order, adding a personal touch to the experience.\n\nThe standout for me was the flavorful mix of Middle Eastern specialties, especially the succulent grilled meats and traditional dishes that were cooked to perfection. The dessert section was equally indulgent, with a wide selection of sweet treats, from freshly baked pastries to decadent cakes and Arabic sweets.\n\nThe staff were attentive and friendly, ensuring that my dining experience was seamless. They frequently checked in to make sure everything was satisfactory, and their professionalism added to the overall enjoyment of the evening.\n\nOverall, my dinner buffet at Hilton Garden Inn was a fantastic experience.

The food was shockingly bland‚Äîgrilled chicken with zero spices, not even a hint of salt! The desserts looked nice, but that‚Äôs where the appeal ended; they tasted just as lifeless as the rest of the meal. Overall, it was a complete waste of money. Safe to say, I won‚Äôt be coming back."
